									I still remember when I was 8, sitting in front of my first Windows 95 Pentium III computer, inserting a floppy disk into the drive just so 
									I can play Space Strike. I have always astonished by the magic stored within this tiny piece of diskette, so I literally opened one up and all 
									I found was disappointment (and a tiny disk, and also a whipping from my older brother). </p>
									<p>It wasn't until 17 that I got exposed to the word "programming". Well, I was heavily addicted to the magic and forgot that I was interested 
									in debunking them. In less than 10 years, magic no longer just happen on my computer with that tiny piece of diskette. They are on my phone, 
									watch, glasses, my fridge, washing machine, vacuum, everywhere! That is when I decided I want to be a magician. </p>
									<p>My journey started with random googling and watching awesome programming tutorial on YouTube 
									(shout out to those Indian YouTuber, you guys are amazing), and eventually getting into college as a computer science major. 
									This passion carried me through my further education at Iowa State University as a software engineer. Here there were much more resources 
									available to me that I could ever imagined as a kid. I studied more about languages, algorithms, project management, databases, all these 
									knowledge that help me understand the truth behind those magic. Now in the industry as a software engineer, my eyes are opened to just how much 
									more there is in this world. Everyday I am ready to learn more, and strive to be a better. </p>
									<p>I am just at the "Hello World!" of life.</p>
